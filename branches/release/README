OVERVIEW
========

The project contains two modules:
    - decoder
    - player

The "decoder" module contains the Java and C code used for wrapping
the underlying AAC decoding algorithm (which is currently the OpenCORE aacdec,
but it could be easily changed).

The "player" module is an example how to use the "decoder" library in your
project.


INSTALLING
==========

Requirements:
    - Android SDK - at least platform 3 (Android 1.5)
    - Android NDK - tested with r6, r9c


Preparing OpenCORE sources:
-------------------------

    You have to download Android OpenCORE sources either by:

        * downloading Android OpenCORE sources from our "Downloads" tab:
            http://code.google.com/p/aacplayer-android/downloads/list

    Please note that each version of thei decoder library needs specific
    OpenCORE version. In the downloads list select that one which 
    is just below the relevant source/libs archives.

    If you download a zip file, then please unzip it.


Compiling:
----------

    1) copy sample.ant.properties to .ant.properties and edit .ant.properties:
        - path to Android SDK
        - path to Android NDK
        - path to Android OpenCORE source

    2) run ant

    3) install the APK on the emulator or a device:
        adb install player/bin/AACMP3Player-debug.apk


USING THE AAC DECODER LIBRARY FOR OTHER PROJECTS
================================================

Preparing:
----------

    You must copy both Java JAR and the shared library files to your
    project's "libs" directory:

        $ cp -R decoder/libs <your_android_project>/libs

Using:
------

    Please look at the example activity using the AAC decoder:

        player/src/com/spoledge/aacplay/AACPlayerActivity.java


USING MAVEN 
===========

Starting with the version 0.7 the project can be built using Maven.

NOTE: You have to configure the .ant.properties to point to the OpenCORE
    sources (see above)

You must install Android 1.5_r4 into your Maven repository.
Please see https://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/ how to use
Maven for Android projects.

When you have you maven for Android ready, then just do:

    $ mvn install

Then start an emulator or attach a device, go to the "decoder" dir
and run:

    $ mvn android:deploy

Using the apklib by other projects is as easy as the demo "player"
is using it (see the player/pom.xml):

    <dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.spoledge.aacdecoder</groupId>
			<artifactId>aacdecoder-lib</artifactId>
			<version>0.8</version>
			<type>apklib</type>
		</dependency>
    </dependencies>
