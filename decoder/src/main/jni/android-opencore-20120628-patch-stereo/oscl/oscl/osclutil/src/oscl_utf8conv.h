    \brief Convert UTF8 byte sequence to Unicode UTF-16 string

           The function converts UTF8 byte sequence (or ASCII sequence) to UTF-16 string.
           The length of input UTF8 byte sequence is specified. It stops at two conditions:
           (A) Whole input UTF8 byte sequence is successfully converted.
           (B) Output buferr is not enough for output, or parse error.
           In case of (A), it adds a terminated '\0' at the end of the output Unicode string,
           and returns length of the output Unicode string(without counting terminated '\0').
           In case of (B), it converts as much as possible to the output buffer and adds a terminated '\0'
           at the end of the output Unicode string"(no '\0' added if outLength is less than or
           equal to 0, return 0)", and returns 0.
     Please note that Unicode character exceeding U+FFFF are not supported.
