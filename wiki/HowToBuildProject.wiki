= System Requirements =

  * Android SDK - at least platform 3 (Android 1.5)
  * Android NDK - rev 6
  * (Apache Ant - http://ant.apache.org/)


= Getting Android OpenCORE Sources =

You have to download Android OpenCORE sources either by:
  * downloading OpenCORE sources from the [Downloads] tab
  * checking-out Android OpenCORE sources from the Androids repository: http://android.git.kernel.org             
    * unfortunately this was working in summer 2011, but there is not an easy way how to download pure OpenCORE module now (spring 2012)
    * If anybody can provide me the full sources (OpenCORE only) I would appreciate it

  * checking-out OpenCORE aacdec sources from the original project: 
http://code.google.com/p/opencore-aacdec/

If you download a zip file, then please unzip it somewhere.
